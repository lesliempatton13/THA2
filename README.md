## **The Effect of Natural Disasters on Student Learning**

**Title of Research:**
The Effect of Natural Disasters on Student Learning: A Case Study of Hurricane Harvey and Gulf Coast School Districts 

**Objectives:**
* To identify any significant changes in student learning after a natural disaster using STAAR (State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness) data of secondary students
* To asses current strategies used by the state of Texas in addressing and accommodating student learning amidst a natural disaster

**Data Sets Used:** 
* STAAR aggregated 2016-2017 English I and 2017-2018 English II campus level data
* High Water Mark Data from USGS during Harvey

**Overview:** 

To date, little research has been done on the effects of student learning and overall achievement after a natural disaster in the community at the secondary level. Hurricane Harvey hit in late August of 2017, damaging regions from the southern Gulf Coast of Texas all the way to the borders of Louisiana. Houston, the largest city affected by the storm, received an unprecedented amount of rainfall causing flood waters to rise throughout the suburbs and city in areas around bayous. Surrounding school districts were shut down for a few weeks to over a month as families were displaced from their homes and lost all belongings to flood waters. 

Post Hurricane Harvey, students eventually returned to schools but remained in a state of recovery in rebuilding their family homes and acquiring new belongings. While much psychological work has been done school-age children and post-natural disaster recovery, far fewer investigations have looked at how these ramifications have impacted student learning in the classroom. The scope of this project seeks to fill that gap in identifying any significant decreases in student learning and achievement in areas affected by Hurricane Harvey along the Gulf Coast of Texas.

The STAAR English I and II data sets reports a variety of indicators to assess student learning. The ones of particular interest are at the campus level of: 
* The percentage of all students tested for a campus 
* The percentage of students that did not meet grade level performance
* The percentage of students approaching grade level performance
* The percentage of students that meets grade level performance
* The percentage of students that master grade level performance

In an attempt to get an accurate snapshot of student learning, the same set of students will be analyzed by looking at the English I 2017 STAAR scores compared to the English II 2018 STAAR scores. Using these indicators, a T-test will be run to determine significant changes at the campus level pre- and post-Harvey. Any significant change will be identified and mapped onto the state of Texas along with all other non-significant change at the campus level using ArcGIS, and overlaid with county level flood inundation to determine areas where both extensive flooding and a decreases in academic achievement occurred. 

The expectation is to find areas where this paradigm exists and run a chi-square test to ensure that the level of flooding is in fact correlated with student learning. Upon looking at campuses and districts heavily effected, the accommodations the campus/district provides will be examined. To date, there exists no natural disaster 504 accommodations, which are accommodations normally given to students with emotional distress, attention deficit disorder, etc. I propose the State of Texas should adopt an “emergency” 504 plan for students immediately after a natural disaster whose families incurred damage and loss of possessions.
