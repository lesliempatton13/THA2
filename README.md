## **The Effect of Natural Disasters on Student Learning**
In 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit the gulf coast, leaving rampant flooding and left schools closed for over a month. Despite the shutdown of many Texas schools during Hurricane Harvey recovery, the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readdiness was still given across subject disciplines. This project seeks to identitfy the effect of natural disasters on student learning and achievement. This will be done using a the same sample of students from an English I STAAR exam in 2017 (during hurricane recovery) and an English II STAAR exam in 2018 (post hurricane recovery). The statistical signifiant changes among student achievement will then be mapped onto the Gulf Coast using ArcGIS and comparing that map with that of the worst hit areas during Hurricane Harvey. The driving policy implication is there are currently no immediate academic acommodations for students impacted by a natural disaster in the state of Texas. If there is a significant change in student learning post-natural disaster, the state should implement 'emergency' accomodations to assist students in an academic setting.
