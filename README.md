## **The Effect of Natural Disasters on Student Learning**

In 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit the gulf coast, leaving rampant flooding and left schools closed for over a month. Despite the shutdown of many Texas schools during Hurricane Harvey recovery, the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readdiness was still given across subject disciplines. This project seeks to identitfy the effect of natural disasters on student learning and achievement. This will be done using a the same sample of students from a district level dataset of the English I STAAR exam in 2017 (during hurricane recovery) and a district level dataset of the English II STAAR exam in 2018 (post hurricane recovery). The statistical signifiant changes among student achievement will then be mapped onto the Gulf Coast using ArcGIS and comparing that map with that of the worst hit areas during Hurricane Harvey. The driving policy implication is there are currently no immediate academic acommodations for students impacted by a natural disaster in the state of Texas. If there is a significant change in student learning post-natural disaster, the state should implement 'emergency' accomodations to assist students in an academic setting.

##### The dataset contains several indicators, however the ones of interest are:
- e1_all_d: All Students Tested
- e1_all_unsatgl_nm: Did not meet grade level performance, All Students
- e1_all_approgl_nm: Approaches grade level performance
- e1_all_meetsgl_nm: Meets grade level performance 
- e1_all_mastrgl_nm: Masters grade level performance

## **Mapping of Minerals in Produced Water in US Oil and Gas Wells**
This dataset from the US Geological Society. The dataset reports on the produced water from oil and gas wells across the United States. Produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas production, yielding a large excess of impure water that must be recycled, put back into the well (fracking), or transported away. Within the last decade, a large focus on recycling this water for resuse has emerged.

My focus using this dataset, is to analyze the output of water in each well, and the impurities in the water across the region, and map the locations of each based on levels of impurities using ArcGIS. This can serve as a resource for portraying and prediciting water output and impurity level based on proximity. This can be useful for continuing to develop novel ways to recycle and clean produced water for the different areas across the United States.

## **Studying the Decline of Life Science Patents**
This data set was pulled from the World Bank Data (https://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators) focusing on the number of patents produce in the United States from 1960-2018. This data set was exported as an excel file and the file is uploded to this repository. Upon obtaining data on the number of science and technology patents specificaly produced across the same time period, I look to compare the levels of overall science and technology patents issued as a ratio of all patents.

There has been much speculation about the decline of science and technology patents due to the overwhelming slowness associated with the patent process and the rapid pace at which technology and science is moving. My hypothesis is seeing a decline in science and technology process and an alternative method to the patent process for these fields.
